    <h1>Dawn Klein - Can Space-Time be Used For Good?</h1>
    <p>Dawn Klein is a story about a girl with superpowers. Follow her journey through time, space, the multiverse and the struggles of good and evil.</p>
    <p>It’s difficult to give this story an age rating, primarily as we haven’t actually written it yet. That being said, there is swearing, and there could be be dark themes and violence later on.</p>
    <p>The story is being worked on by Nathan Windisch and Ryan Krage, two nerds who share a passion for superheroes and powers. The plan is for a new chapter to be uploaded once a week on Thursday, with our editing session being on Thursday, and our writing session being on Monday.</p>
